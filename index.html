<h3><span class="experience-title">Assistant IT Officer - Grande Int'l Hospital</span><span class="location">| Feb 2022 - Present</span></h3> <strong><i>(Bridging Technology and Healthcare)</i></strong>
<p>
In my role at Grande International Hospital, I act as the go-to IT troubleshooter for staff members, ensuring seamless operations in a fast-paced healthcare environment. 
  A typical day involves resolving technical inquiries—from fixing printer malfunctions and diagnosing network outages to untangling complex PACS/HIMS errors. 
  By streamlining communication with vendors and refining troubleshooting protocols, I’ve reduced average resolution times, minimizing disruptions to patient care.

One of my key projects was supporting the integration of the Picture Archiving System (PACS), which decucted medical image retrieval time, allowing doctors to diagnose patients faster. 
  I also collaborated on migrating the hospital’s HIMS and email servers to a cloud-based solution, a project that improved remote data accessibility while safeguarding sensitive patient 
  information through encryption and multi-factor authentication.

Behind the scenes, I partner with cross-functional teams to evaluate and upgrade IT infrastructure, ensuring uptime for systems critical to clinical operations. 
  Every day, I’m reminded that reliable technology isn’t just about servers and code—it’s about enabling healthcare professionals to focus on what matters most: their patients.

<h3><span class="experience-title">Freelance Developer</span><span class="location">| 2017 - 2019</span></h3> <strong><i>(Turning Ideas into Impactful Tools)</i></strong>
<p>
During my freelance tenure with KFA Business School, I designed and built a custom Sales Tracking System for Himalayan Bank and Shangri-La Development Bank. 
  This PHP/MySQL platform automated manual data entry and provided real-time sales analytics, boosting team efficiency. 
  Security was a top priority: I implemented role-based access controls and MD5 encryption to ensure compliance with strict data protection standards, 
  earning praise from stakeholders for balancing usability with robust security.

To create a truly user-friendly experience, I interviewed users and stakeholders to identify pain points and redesigned the interface from the ground up. 
  The new UI simplified report generation with dynamic filters (e.g., date ranges, bank branches), cutting task time. I also authored step-by-step
  manuals and trained users, achieving about 95% adoption rate within two months, a testament to the system’s intuitive design.

This project taught me that great software isn’t just functional — it’s empathetic. By listening to users and iterating on feedback, we built a tool that felt less like a system and more like a teammate.

  My academic journey began at Rhododendron International Boarding School, where I earned my SLC (School Leaving Certificate). 
  Later, I pursued a B.Sc. in Business Computing & Information Systems from Softwarica College of IT (affiliated with the University of Central Lancashire, UK). 
  Here, I honed my skills in software development, database management, and IT project workflows—foundations that continue to shape my problem-solving approach today.
