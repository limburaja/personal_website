<h3><span class="experience-title">Web application developer (Freelance) - KFA</span><span class="location">Mid Baneshwor, Kathmandu</span></h3>
<p>
<strong>2017-2019</strong>
</p>
<p>
During my freelancing at KFA Business School from 2017 to 2019, I designed and implemented a Sales Tracking System for Himalayan Bank Ltd. and Shangri-La Development Bank using PHP, MySQL, CSS, and JavaScript.
This system improved sales team efficiency by 20% through streamlined data entry and real-time performance monitoring.

I established robust data security protocols with user access controls and secure password storage, ensuring compliance with data protection as per the client needs. By conducting user research and usability testing,
  I created an intuitive interface that enabled users to generate reports and search by criteria like bank branch and date range, enhancing operational efficiency. I also developed user manuals and conducted
  training sessions to facilitate smooth onboarding, resulting in higher adoption rates and user satisfaction.

<h3><span class="experience-title">Assistant IT Officer - Grande Int'l Hospital</span><span class="location">Dhapasi, Tokha</span></h3>
<p>
<strong>Feb 2022 - Ongoing</strong>
</p>
<p>
As an Assistant IT Officer at Grande International Hospital since February 2022, I serve as the primary contact for Hospital Information Management System (HIMS) support,
  adeptly resolving issues and enhancing user engagement. We developed and delivered training programs for hospital staff, leading to increased efficiency
  and reduced user error rates.
  
The integration of the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) into hospital workflows was successfully carried out, with the IT department at the center of the project. 
  We managed the appropriate environment, provided necessary support, and acted as a bridge between hospital management and vendors, improving the storage and retrieval of
  medical images, which in turn enhanced diagnostic speed and patient outcomes. The migration of the Hospital Information Management System (HIMS) and the email server to a cloud-based
  solution was managed effectively, improving data accessibility and scalability. Robust security measures, including encryption and multi-factor authentication, were implemented to protect
  sensitive patient information.

Additionally, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to evaluate and upgrade the hospital’s IT infrastructure, ensuring minimal downtime and high service levels.
My project management efforts include planning and coordinating IT initiatives, monitoring project progress, and aligning technology upgrades with organizational goals.
